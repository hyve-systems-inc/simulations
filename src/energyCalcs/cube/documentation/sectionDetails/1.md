# Analysis of Section I: System Overview

## 1. Purpose and Scope

### Overview

Section I establishes the fundamental physical domain and state variables for modeling a refrigerated container with forced air cooling. It defines the spatial discretization approach and core variables tracked throughout the simulation.

### Key Physical Principles

- Spatial discretization of container volume
- Multi-zone air flow patterns
- Vertical stratification in pallets
- Conservation of mass and energy within defined zones
- State variable definitions for heat and mass transfer

### Critical Outputs

- Zonal temperatures (product and air)
- Moisture content distribution
- State variable evolution over time
- Spatial resolution of cooling patterns

## 2. Mathematical Framework

### 2.1 Equation Statement

#### Physical Domain Parameters

```
Container: L × W × H (length, width, height)
Zones: i = 1 to N (sequential along airflow)
Layers: j = 1 to M (vertical within pallet)
Pallets: p = 1 to P (per zone)
```

#### State Variables

For each zone i and layer j:

```
Tp,i,j(t) = Product temperature [°C]
wp,i,j(t) = Product moisture content [kg water/kg dry matter]
Ta,i(t) = Air temperature [°C]
wa,i(t) = Air humidity ratio [kg water/kg dry air]
```

## 3. Implementation Guidelines

### 3.1 Numerical Considerations

#### Discretization Requirements

- Minimum zones (N): Typically 4-8 for adequate resolution
- Minimum layers (M): Typically 3-5 per pallet
- Zone size: Based on characteristic mixing length
- Layer height: Based on vertical temperature gradients

#### Data Structure Design

```typescript
interface ZonalState {
  productTemp: number[][]; // [zone][layer]
  productMoisture: number[][]; // [zone][layer]
  airTemp: number[]; // [zone]
  airHumidity: number[]; // [zone]
}
```

#### Spatial Coupling

- Air conditions affect adjacent zones
- Vertical stratification affects layer interactions
- Product-air interactions within each zone
- Mass and energy conservation across boundaries

#### Variable Interdependencies

- Temperature affects moisture capacity
- Moisture affects heat transfer
- Air flow affects both temperature and moisture distribution

### 3.3 Boundary Conditions

#### Required Inputs

- Container dimensions
- Pallet configuration
- Initial conditions for all state variables
- Cooling unit location and properties

#### Interface Conditions

- Zone boundaries: Continuous air properties
- Layer boundaries: Heat and mass transfer resistance
