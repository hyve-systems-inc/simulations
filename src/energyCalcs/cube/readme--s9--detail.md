- Operating envelope definitions
- Safety threshold values
- Control system limits

## 2. Mathematical Framework

### 2.1 Physical Bounds Equations

#### Air Humidity Constraint

```
0 ≤ wa,i ≤ wsat(Ta,i)
```

- Units: kg water/kg dry air
- Physical meaning: Air humidity cannot be negative or exceed saturation
- Term analysis:
  - wa,i: Actual humidity ratio at position i
  - wsat(Ta,i): Saturation humidity ratio at local temperature
  - Function wsat(T) derived from psychrometric relations

#### Product Moisture Content

```
0 ≤ wp,i,j ≤ wp,initial
```

- Units: kg water/kg dry matter
- Range significance:
  - Lower bound: Complete dehydration
  - Upper bound: Initial moisture content
- Physical basis: Conservation of mass

#### Temperature Bounds

```
Tdp ≤ Ta,i ≤ Text
```

- Units: °C or K
- Critical points:
  - Tdp: Dew point temperature of cooling coil
  - Ta,i: Local air temperature
  - Text: External ambient temperature
- Physical basis: Second law of thermodynamics

### 2.2 Operational Limits

#### Turbulent Cooling Performance Index

```
TCPI_min ≤ TCPI(t) ≤ 1.0
```

- Units: Dimensionless
- Range significance:
  - TCPI_min: Minimum acceptable cooling performance
  - 1.0: Ideal performance benchmark
- System implications: Controls cooling unit operation

#### Cooling Capacity

```
0 ≤ Qcool,i ≤ Qcool,max
```

- Units: Watts or BTU/hr
- Physical basis: Equipment limitations
- Critical for:
  - Compressor protection
  - Energy efficiency
  - System stability

#### Air Velocity Constraints

```
v_min ≤ vi,j ≤ v_max
```

- Units: m/s
- Range determination:
  - v_min: Minimum for adequate heat transfer
  - v_max: Maximum for product protection and fan capabilities
